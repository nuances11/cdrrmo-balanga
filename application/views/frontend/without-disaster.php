				<em></em>Without Disaster
            </h3>

            In the aftermath of a disaster, time is a valuable, yet extremely limited source. Recovery and rehabilitation is an immense task of assisting individuals, communities, economies and the natural environment to recover in a coordinated, efficient and risk-reducing manner. To do so requires thorough and deliberate assessment and planning. Yet this type of planning is usually forfeit in the demand for haste. To address this dilemma, efforts in preparing for recovery and rehabilitation in advance is encouraged.

            Pro-active process of anticipating future recovery issues, developing a scenario-based recovery plan, and building the capacity to improve recovery outcomes â€“ all before a disaster happens. Strong evidence, and common sense, indicates that much can be done before a disaster to alleviate recovery planning demands after the disaster. Critical information can be gathered; tools to assess needs and provide assistance can be analyzed and prepared, and roles and responsibilities can be defined. Additionally, streamlined processes can be developed to expedite recovery efforts and partnerships established to leverage additional resources.

            Empowerment of the community to manage disaster risk on their own is one of the mitigation efforts being practice by the City. Community Based DRRM enables community involvement in defining recovery priorities and strategies before a disaster happens and can ensure their participation after a disaster occurs. Community are able to identify, analyze, treat, monitor and evaluate disaster risks in their area.

The lessons learned by the community from previous disaster recovery and rehabilitation is the vital tool that motivates everyone to promote greater participation towards disaster resiliency.
