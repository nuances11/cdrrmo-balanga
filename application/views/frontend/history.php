            BALANGA was formerly a vista of Abucay before it was established as a mission of the Dominican Order in the Provincial Chapter of April 21, 1714 and later declared a vicariate on April 18, 1739, under the patronage of Saint Joseph. Upon the establishment of Bataan as a separate province in 1754, Balanga was made its capital by General Pedro Manuel Arandia due to its favorable location, at the heart of the new territorial jurisdiction. The word Balanga originates from the Tagalog word baÃ±ga (clay pot), which the town used to produce and, which was among the best that can be found in the country. The legendary version where the name Balanga originated is as follows (Municipality of Balanga, 2000):

                Diumano, nagpabando si Raha Mulawin na kung sino man ang makagagawa ng pinakamalakiâ€™t pinakamatibay na balanga na siyang sasakyan ng prinsesa sa kaniyang pagtawid sa malaking sapa ay siya nitong makakaisang dibdib. Sa dami ng balangang ginawa, ang kay Prinsipe Layak ang pinakamalaki at pinakamatibay kayaâ€™t sa madaling sabi, sa balangang ito idinaos ang kasalan at magmula noon, â€œBalangaâ€ ang itinawag sa pook na itong may romansang ingat. Ayon naman sa ilang matatanda, nasulat daw sa kasaysayan ang pangalang â€œBalangaâ€ dahilan sa isang nakatutuwang pangyayari. Bago pa man daw dumating ang mga Kastila sa Pilipinas, ang bayan ng Balanga ay isang kaakit-akit na pook. Marami raw itong pagawaan ng balanga. Minsan, dalawang kawal Kastila raw ang namasyal sakay ng kabayo. Hangang-hanga sila sa mga namasid. Ipinagtanong tuloy nila ang ngalan ng pook na ito na binalak nilang lalong paunlarin. Isang babae raw na may sunong na balanga ng tubig ang kanilang napagtanungan. At dahil hindi nga marunong ng tagalog ang dalawang sundalo, humigit-kumulang ay ito ang naging usapan nila. â€œ Ho! Ho! Hooo!â€ pigil sa tumatakbong kabayo sabay lundag sa harap ng nabiglang babae. â€œAy, Sino kayaâ€™ng mga ito?, pagulat na tanong ng babae. â€œAno kayang pakay nito sa akin?â€ Takot na takot, hinigpitan niya ang pagkakahawak sa balangang sunong. Umakmang tatakbo. Nguniâ€™t naudlot ng tanungin ng kawal. â€œQue lugar es este, senorita?â€ (Anong pook ito binibini?) tanong ng makisig na kawal habang pigil ng mariin ang braso ng balangang sunong. â€œSi, que lugar es este senorita?â€ ulit ng pandak, hagod ng tingin ang balangang sunong ng babae habang inaayos ang nalisyang sable sa lalagyan. Lalong nagtumiin sa isip ng babae na itinanong nila kung ano ang kaniyang sunong. â€œ Nakupo! Masabi na nga kung ano itong aking sunong.â€ Nahihintakutang bulong ng babae. â€œBaka ako saksakin kung hindi ko sasabihin. Talagang salbahe!â€ at kumarimot ng takbo ang pobre habang sumisigaw ng â€œbalanga! balanga! balanga! â€œ Halos madurog ang hawak ng balanga sa higpit ng pagkakahawak. Hindi nito alintana ang pagtawag ng Kastila. Gulilat, nagkatinginan lang ang dalawa. â€œPorque?â€ tanong ng pandak. Ngunit walang narinig na sagot sa kasama. Iiling-iling, muling sumakay sa kabayo ang dalawang sundalo. â€œKung gayoâ€™y balanga pala ang tawag sa lugar na itoâ€, sa wikang Kastilaâ€™y sambit ng pandak sabay baling sa kasamang nagkamot ng ulo. â€œTsk...Tsk...Tsk... Si BALANGA, BALANGA, BALANGA,â€ may kakaibang ngiting salo ng makisig na kawal sabay sulat sa munting kuwadernong hawak. At magpahanggang ngayon, â€œBalangaâ€ ang tawag sa kabiserang bayan ng Bataan.

            Despite the ravages of fire, Balanga has many large structures. One of the oldest provincial government building in the archipelago is found in this town. It was erected in 1729. Balanga was inaugurated as a city on December 30, 2000 by virtue of Republic Act 8984. For the last ten years, there has been a rapid economic growth in its urban areas. Commercial establishments, including financing institutions have proliferated in the City.

                                    The local government and CDRRMO partake in aspiring to be a disaster resilient city. And as embedded in our city mission, the words â€œPARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCEâ€ channels our approach on disaster management and Climate Change Adaptation, which I also believe correspond to the intent of R.A. 10121, a bottom-up and participatory disaster risk reduction. . An empowered community and citizenry with the ability to make decision and perform on its own coincide with the attainment of this objective. The program COB DRRM that was introduced by the CDRRMO has given those who are directly affected, the necessary skills to assess their own vulnerability, to identify their capacity, and to create their own programs and proposals aptly analyzed based on the knowledge that they have accumulated and on their own real life experiences."

                                The city recognizes the need and value of critical infrastructure and modern rescue equipment in dealing with disaster management, but heavily stresses the fact that community involvement with shared responsibility predominate the previous. Various trainings that were subsequently given only to those employees with certain positions are now being cascaded down to the barangay level, such as Training of Trainers and Specialized Rescue training. The primary intention is for the community to attain self-reliance. Although DRRM plan has been crafted with emphasis on both pre and post disaster, many factors can disturb its regularity. We have to make certain that each barangay can stand by itself until definitive assistance is delivered.

                                Furthermore, the city shares the same attitude with CDRRMO as being pro-active. I strongly believe that investment in disaster preparedness saves us from future losses, not to mention, the loss of human lives.

                                Our realization to becoming the â€œEmerging Hub for Technology based Businesses in the Philippinesâ€ may be influenced by other factors but its preservation to a certain degree is dependent on the vigilance of the community in disaster management. Climate change and its effect are inevitable. Our adaptability to changes and strategies apropos to prevention and mitigation, preparedness, response, and rehabilitation and recovery are what would make the immense difference in sustaining to be a World Class City.â€

                                As we move forward to a DISASTER RESILIENT FUTURE, CDRRMO and the City Government of Balangaâ€™s commitment has never enervated but rather profoundly gained support from the stakeholders, signifying the culmination of hardship and effort with regards to the policies and programs that have been initiated, concerning Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation-Mitigation. Communityâ€™s awareness has been raised through information dissemination by the consolidation of local disaster risk information, including the conduction of training and orientation to every level of our locality. Cooperation and coordination amongst the local government, CDRRMO, NGOâ€™s, and different barangays have been established, and reliable programs have been put in place. Yet CDDRMOâ€™s obligation is only at its preface. Reaching out to every single constituent within our area of responsibility regarding disaster preparedness and emerging issues are always in motion, but as important is the continuing studies and training of those who are entrusted to supervise and educate, in order to elevate the knowledge and raise the standard pursuance to the ever changing disaster research and reviews.

Furthermore, our primary objective is to tailor-made the risk reduction and management plan accustom to the assessed vulnerability of each and every barangay, as well as to empower them to deal with any unpredictable event that we may encounter.
